# NLP-Twitter-Disaster-tweets-classification
The competition datasets conatin about 10,000 tweets from twitter. Twitter has always been an important communication portal for people all over the world. People use twitter to talk about real-world incidents/accidents theyâ€™re observing in real-time. We, humans may can easily decide whether a person is tweeting about real disaster or not. But a machine needs some sophisticated model and cleaned data to do that. In this project I will try to build a model which will analyze the datasets provided and give verdict if the tweet is depicting a real disaster (1) or not (0).
