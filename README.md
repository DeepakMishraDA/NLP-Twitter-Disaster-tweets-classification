The project is an exploration of text data by the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and unsupervised learning. The project tries to label Tweets with keywords in proximity to disaster as such, by predicting if the tweet is about disaster or not. There are 10,000 tweets in total which have been taken as data-points for text analysis.
